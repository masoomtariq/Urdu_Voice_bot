# Urdu_Voice_bot

This a Urdu voice chatbot created using Streamlit. It takes in Urdu voice input and response in Urdu voice
    
    
Development process includes these steps.  
    1️⃣ Convert Voice into text, using Google's speech recognition API.  
    2️⃣ Give text to LLM (I used Gemini), and generate a response.
    we can also fine-tune LLM for URDU for more accurate responses).  
    3️⃣ Convert LLM-generated text into URDU speech by using Google TTS API.
